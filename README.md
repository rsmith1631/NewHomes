# NewHomes
Build a project of a home developer community. 
Should provide information that most home developers provide. View developers such as Lennar, Dr. Horton, Toll Brothers and others to get an idea. 
Build a site and display it for user interaction, providing viewable homes, necessary development information, and whatâ€™s provided by you as the builder.
Make a section where the client can pre-qualify for the homes.
Provide fake contact information and more so the client will have the opportunity to contact you as the builder.
